00:01:10.671 --> 00:01:13.465
Yo, Jimmy. Give me the status.
Tell me we good.

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:15.301
- You got it, man.
- Beautiful.

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:18.512
It's gonna be an all-timer tonight.

00:01:22.683 --> 00:01:25.603
All right, fire them up!

00:01:26.145 --> 00:01:27.938
We go live in five!

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:32.151
It's time for ignition
and straight automobile pimping.

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:05.726
- Girl!
- Sorry! My bad!

00:02:10.647 --> 00:02:13.192
All right, ladies! We're good.

00:02:13.984 --> 00:02:15.319
We're good.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.613
That's it, babies.

00:02:20.783 --> 00:02:23.243
Come on, Tej!
Let's get this race going!

00:02:24.328 --> 00:02:26.038
Wait a second, man.

00:02:26.121 --> 00:02:28.874
You cats are first wave.
Where's your fourth at?

00:02:28.957 --> 00:02:32.086
It was Joaquin, but he had
to work the graveyard shift.

00:02:32.169 --> 00:02:34.546
What? Graveyard shift, man.

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.301
- Why don't you run with us, Tej?
- Hell, I'm not running with y'all.

00:02:39.635 --> 00:02:43.472
I tell you, either you find a fourth
or you don't race. How about that?

00:02:43.555 --> 00:02:47.059
We should find two, so we don't have
to roll with skirt here.

00:02:52.564 --> 00:02:54.399
Whoa, wait a second.

00:02:54.775 --> 00:02:58.529
Why don't I find you a fourth
and we settle this on the streets?

00:02:58.612 --> 00:03:00.948
- Bring him on.
- Anybody I want?

00:03:01.323 --> 00:03:03.325
No matter who it is?

00:03:03.408 --> 00:03:04.576
Yeah.

00:03:10.124 --> 00:03:11.208
Yeah?

00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:13.210
Yeah, man. You want to race tonight?

00:03:13.293 --> 00:03:16.213
I could use the money.
You got four minutes.

00:03:16.922 --> 00:03:18.257
I'll be there.

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:48.120
The race starts in four minutes.

00:03:49.955 --> 00:03:52.040
All right, girls, let's do this.

00:04:03.176 --> 00:04:06.013
- You think you'll win, baby?
- What do you think?

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:09.600
- You better. We got rent to pay.
- I know this.

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.961
I'll get you when you
get a car worth racing.

00:04:47.137 --> 00:04:48.513
There's our fourth.

00:04:48.597 --> 00:04:50.307
Shit. It's Brian.

00:05:19.461 --> 00:05:21.838
- What's up, Tej?
- What's happening, dude?

00:05:21.922 --> 00:05:24.966
- Thanks for the invite.
- No problem at all, man.

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.552
Just remember me
when you wax, all right?

00:05:28.929 --> 00:05:30.555
They got deep pockets?

00:05:31.765 --> 00:05:32.891
Real deep.

00:05:35.435 --> 00:05:37.813
- What's up, Suki?
- What's up, Bullitt?

00:05:37.896 --> 00:05:39.648
What do you say we kick it a nickel?

00:05:41.191 --> 00:05:43.318
Nobody mentioned raising stakes.

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:51.451
If that's the case,
ask these nice people...

00:05:51.535 --> 00:05:53.954
to back off the line
so you can go home.

00:06:04.965 --> 00:06:07.509
Okay. $3,500.

00:06:17.644 --> 00:06:18.895
$3,500?

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:22.232
Either that
or you can go home, bruh.

00:06:27.445 --> 00:06:29.614
It's all there.
Better be.

00:06:30.782 --> 00:06:34.369
Damn, Suki, when are you
going to pop my clutch?

00:06:34.452 --> 00:06:36.621
As soon as you get
the right set of tools.

00:06:36.705 --> 00:06:37.956
All right.

00:06:58.184 --> 00:07:00.437
All right, back up. Let's go.

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:03.982
Back y'all asses up!

00:07:04.065 --> 00:07:06.568
Back up before
you turn into barbecue around here.

00:07:06.818 --> 00:07:09.029
It's not a game. This is serious.

00:07:09.112 --> 00:07:12.365
All right, back up.
Get off the street. Let's go.

00:07:12.532 --> 00:07:16.453
Back it up. Everybody keep
your heads real clear, all right?

00:07:16.536 --> 00:07:18.788
'Cause I got a surprise
for y'all this evening.

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:23.710
Go, Slap Jack! Go, baby!

00:07:23.793 --> 00:07:25.295
I got this.

00:07:34.846 --> 00:07:36.723
Ready?

00:07:40.518 --> 00:07:41.686
Go!

00:08:32.779 --> 00:08:34.155
Oh, hell, no!

00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:51.798
You ain't passing me, dawg. Come on.

00:08:54.467 --> 00:08:55.718
What you got?

00:09:02.016 --> 00:09:04.018
I told you, you wouldn't pass me!

00:09:16.906 --> 00:09:18.158
Move, bitch!

00:10:07.248 --> 00:10:08.666
Not tonight, baby!

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:10.668
Bend over, boy.

00:10:14.339 --> 00:10:15.590
Damn, girl!

00:10:26.851 --> 00:10:28.144
Last turn.

00:10:30.855 --> 00:10:31.940
Too wide.

00:10:43.451 --> 00:10:44.953
Home stretch, baby.

00:10:53.753 --> 00:10:55.129
Got to go, dawg!

00:11:14.565 --> 00:11:15.650
Yes!

00:11:27.453 --> 00:11:28.496
I can smell you!

00:11:28.955 --> 00:11:30.623
Yo, Jimmy, hit it, baby!

00:11:36.045 --> 00:11:37.922
All right. Y'all see that?

00:11:39.048 --> 00:11:41.008
I told y'all I had a surprise.

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:43.636
How you like that for a finale?

00:11:53.104 --> 00:11:54.147
Bridge.

00:12:36.189 --> 00:12:37.315
Yeah!

00:12:41.611 --> 00:12:42.653
Shit!

00:12:52.955 --> 00:12:54.457
Oh, hell, no!

00:12:59.629 --> 00:13:01.047
Smack that ass!

00:13:25.571 --> 00:13:26.614
Yes!

00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:38.751
I saw that, man.
Bullitt and Suki sprayed the bridge.

00:13:39.043 --> 00:13:41.754
I need to start making
y'all pay to see this shit.

00:13:41.837 --> 00:13:44.590
I got over $10,000
for my man here, all right?

00:13:44.924 --> 00:13:47.843
That's what I'm talking about, man.
Play with it.

00:13:48.427 --> 00:13:50.805
- Smells good, don't it?
- How about that?

00:13:50.888 --> 00:13:53.391
Right. Y'all see this?
Everybody take a good look.

00:13:53.474 --> 00:13:56.769
This is what you call mutual
respect. All right, let's clear out.

00:13:57.603 --> 00:13:59.605
Anybody down for another race?

00:14:00.898 --> 00:14:01.941
Shit.

00:14:06.278 --> 00:14:08.990
Make sure you bring that body
by the garage later...

00:14:09.073 --> 00:14:12.576
so we can work
on that front end of yours.

00:14:13.744 --> 00:14:14.870
Watch out.

00:14:15.997 --> 00:14:17.498
Maybe I will.

00:14:25.214 --> 00:14:26.757
Where are you going?

00:14:27.591 --> 00:14:30.052
- Time to get out of here.
- Why is that?

00:15:04.086 --> 00:15:05.796
Nissan Skyline! Got him!

00:15:16.098 --> 00:15:17.683
Shit!

00:15:41.165 --> 00:15:42.333
Damn!

00:15:50.341 --> 00:15:52.551
Let me see your hands!
Put them up!

00:15:53.636 --> 00:15:55.346
Yeah, this is him.
We got him.

00:16:06.523 --> 00:16:10.569
So, how long
you been in South Florida?

00:16:10.653 --> 00:16:12.571
A while.
Before that?

00:16:15.866 --> 00:16:18.953
We know you're Brian O'Conner,
formerly of the LAPD.

00:16:19.828 --> 00:16:21.914
- You got the wrong guy.
- Really?

00:16:26.877 --> 00:16:28.629
How you doing, O'Conner?

00:16:31.924 --> 00:16:33.384
Let's take a walk.

00:16:36.303 --> 00:16:37.554
Carter Verone.

00:16:38.013 --> 00:16:41.225
Born in Argentina, but he's lived
most of his life in Miami.

00:16:41.725 --> 00:16:44.812
Now he owns the biggest
import-export business in the state.

00:16:44.895 --> 00:16:48.649
Unfortunately, the cartels have been
successful getting drugs into Miami.

00:16:48.732 --> 00:16:51.193
But they've had a hard time
getting the cash out.

00:16:51.277 --> 00:16:53.070
We've surveilled him for a year.

00:16:53.153 --> 00:16:55.864
But we haven't been able to put him
and the money together.

00:16:55.948 --> 00:16:58.659
- We've swept his house, warehouses-
- Nothing.

00:16:59.118 --> 00:17:02.037
Customs here has done a great job
of getting us this far.

00:17:02.121 --> 00:17:04.164
I'm here to help get them
over the top.

00:17:04.248 --> 00:17:06.542
I was able to get
an agent in undercover...

00:17:06.625 --> 00:17:08.877
working travel and
logistics for him.

00:17:09.003 --> 00:17:11.630
Verone's put her in charge
of finding new drivers.

00:17:11.714 --> 00:17:15.175
Right, although we can't confirm
her status right now.

00:17:15.551 --> 00:17:19.138
- You think she's flipped?
- She's one of mine. She's all right.

00:17:19.221 --> 00:17:23.308
She's been in with Verone a year.
Even lives at the compound with him.

00:17:23.392 --> 00:17:27.521
Look, it was the FBI's idea
to bring you in. I'm against it.

00:17:27.813 --> 00:17:31.692
But we need good drivers to put
this asshole and his money together.

00:17:31.984 --> 00:17:34.153
You're gonna roll with Agent Dunn.

00:17:34.695 --> 00:17:35.988
And if I don't?

00:17:36.447 --> 00:17:39.116
Here's a list of the laws
you broke in L.A.

00:17:39.533 --> 00:17:42.911
Obstruction of justice, aiding and
abetting. You know the rap sheet.

00:17:42.995 --> 00:17:46.582
We can make this all go away
in the interest of justice...

00:17:47.332 --> 00:17:49.501
if you're willing to play ball.

00:17:52.629 --> 00:17:56.592
What's the idea here? Dunn and I
are supposed to be street racers?

00:17:56.717 --> 00:17:58.010
That's right.

00:18:04.099 --> 00:18:05.309
So, Dunn...

00:18:08.312 --> 00:18:10.564
looks like we're
going to be partners, bro.

00:18:10.647 --> 00:18:12.524
Tell me, what would be
a better motor...

00:18:12.608 --> 00:18:15.194
for my Skyline,
a Gallo 12 or a Gallo 24?

00:18:20.574 --> 00:18:21.825
Twenty four.

00:18:22.910 --> 00:18:25.287
I didn't know
pizza places made motors.

00:18:28.123 --> 00:18:30.417
See, man, come on, I can't do this.

00:18:30.793 --> 00:18:34.963
If this is what you'll give me,
I'll take my chances in Chino.

00:18:36.131 --> 00:18:37.841
We'll get someone else.

00:18:38.842 --> 00:18:40.302
No way, man.

00:18:42.346 --> 00:18:45.641
The only way I'll do this is
if I get to pick the driver.

00:18:47.184 --> 00:18:49.853
All right, O'Conner.
Who you got in mind?

00:18:50.437 --> 00:18:53.774
- A dude I grew up with in Barstow.
- Who's that?

00:18:54.816 --> 00:18:56.109
Roman Pearce.

00:19:20.676 --> 00:19:23.387
That him in the Monte Carlo?
That's him.

00:19:25.013 --> 00:19:26.890
He's got some skills.

00:19:27.224 --> 00:19:29.726
And he's crazy as hell,
I'm telling you.

00:19:30.769 --> 00:19:33.188
In a good way, though.
He's the man for the job.

00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:41.655
And he has quite a record,
including three years upstate.

00:19:42.114 --> 00:19:44.116
Says here,
he's on house arrest now.

00:19:44.199 --> 00:19:46.785
Can't go more than
100 yards from his home.

00:20:25.073 --> 00:20:27.034
He always said he'd be famous.

00:20:31.496 --> 00:20:32.748
Pearce!

00:20:33.999 --> 00:20:35.375
Roman Pearce!

00:20:37.002 --> 00:20:39.337
Whatever happens next,
just let it go.

00:20:39.588 --> 00:20:40.839
I ain't in it.

00:20:44.092 --> 00:20:45.260
Rome!

00:20:51.433 --> 00:20:53.852
Only my homeboys call me Rome...

00:20:54.352 --> 00:20:55.479
pig.

00:20:59.691 --> 00:21:02.402
- I'm not a cop anymore.
- Is that true?

00:21:04.529 --> 00:21:06.198
Blondie here is not a cop anymore?

00:21:06.239 --> 00:21:08.575
That's true. No badge.

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:22.047
Here we go.

00:21:33.058 --> 00:21:36.019
You still fight like shit.

00:21:37.187 --> 00:21:39.022
You better chill.

00:21:39.981 --> 00:21:42.400
- Why are you here?
- I'll choke you.

00:21:42.484 --> 00:21:44.611
I told you to stay away from me.

00:21:48.865 --> 00:21:51.910
You should have told me.
I did three years, Brian.

00:21:51.993 --> 00:21:53.703
I told you it wasn't my fault.

00:22:03.755 --> 00:22:05.549
Why did you come here?

00:22:09.636 --> 00:22:11.304
I got a deal for you.

00:22:15.141 --> 00:22:18.186
When I needed your ass,
you were nowhere to be found.

00:22:19.896 --> 00:22:22.148
Now you're trying to hand out deals?

00:22:25.402 --> 00:22:27.612
I need you to come to Miami
and drive with me.

00:22:27.696 --> 00:22:30.991
If you do, they'll take off
that anklet and clear your record.

00:22:31.074 --> 00:22:33.201
I did three years in jail.

00:22:34.077 --> 00:22:35.996
Three years over you, Brian.

00:22:36.997 --> 00:22:39.833
- I know you better than you think.
- Maybe you don't.

00:22:39.916 --> 00:22:41.459
Maybe you don't.

00:22:42.335 --> 00:22:43.878
You guys finished?

00:22:44.754 --> 00:22:46.423
Is this deal legit?

00:22:47.007 --> 00:22:49.509
That's right.
If you do this job for us.

00:22:49.843 --> 00:22:52.095
- I told you.
- Shut up, punk.

00:22:53.888 --> 00:22:57.684
So you'll clean my record
and get this thing off my ankle.

00:22:57.767 --> 00:22:59.060
That's right.

00:22:59.644 --> 00:23:02.939
I thought you couldn't wander
more than 100 yards from your home.

00:23:03.023 --> 00:23:05.608
Why do you think
I'm parked so close to the derby?

00:23:05.692 --> 00:23:08.028
Quit playing
like you'll pass this up.

00:23:09.654 --> 00:23:11.197
You stupid...

00:23:40.810 --> 00:23:42.145
Wait. Hold on.

00:23:44.564 --> 00:23:46.232
Bro, what's going on?

00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:49.569
I don't know if
I should be trusting you, man.

00:23:52.655 --> 00:23:56.743
Think of it this way. It's a chance
for a fresh start. Let's do this.

00:23:56.826 --> 00:23:59.871
I wouldn't need a fresh start
if it wasn't for you.

00:24:00.205 --> 00:24:02.457
You've been using that
since you got busted.

00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:05.919
- Let's just chill out and do this.
- I don't need to chill out.

00:24:06.002 --> 00:24:09.297
Yes, you do. And you need to stop
blaming me for your mistakes.

00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:12.675
Roman Pearce needs to start taking
responsibility for his actions.

00:24:12.759 --> 00:24:16.304
- You need to go to hell.
- You need to go back to Barstow.

00:24:19.015 --> 00:24:21.351
I'm not going back
to Barstow.

00:24:31.986 --> 00:24:35.406
Brian O'Conner,
Roman Pearce, meet Monica Fuentes.

00:24:35.490 --> 00:24:38.243
- They have background on Verone?
- They've been briefed.

00:24:38.326 --> 00:24:40.620
Good.
All right, here's the deal.

00:24:40.703 --> 00:24:43.790
Verone's looking for drivers.
I arranged for you two to join.

00:24:43.873 --> 00:24:46.167
I also hired some thugs
to make it legit.

00:24:46.251 --> 00:24:48.419
- When do we start?
- Right now.

00:24:48.878 --> 00:24:50.421
What are we driving?

00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:00.640
Don't even think about
taking the convertible.

00:25:00.723 --> 00:25:02.684
It might loosen your mousse.

00:25:02.934 --> 00:25:05.645
That's cool.
Too much chrome for me anyways.

00:25:05.728 --> 00:25:10.358
Damn! Where do you all
confiscate these rims from, man?

00:25:10.984 --> 00:25:13.236
Check in with us after you meet him.

00:25:14.821 --> 00:25:17.866
- You okay with these knuckleheads?
- I can handle them.

00:25:17.949 --> 00:25:20.994
- If they trouble you, let me know.
- Thanks, Markham.

00:25:24.414 --> 00:25:26.082
I ride with you, cowboy.

00:25:26.749 --> 00:25:28.293
Why she gotta ride with you?

00:25:28.376 --> 00:25:30.545
You get the convertible.
Let's go.

00:25:45.059 --> 00:25:46.436
Turn right here.

00:25:51.024 --> 00:25:53.610
- So, you used to be a cop?
- Yeah.

00:25:55.278 --> 00:25:57.030
How long you been under?

00:25:57.864 --> 00:25:59.198
I lost track.

00:26:00.033 --> 00:26:01.284
You all right?

00:26:03.328 --> 00:26:06.456
You might want to keep
your eyes on the road, playboy.

00:26:06.831 --> 00:26:09.834
- You think we're gonna crash?
- I haven't decided yet.

00:26:14.672 --> 00:26:16.507
What are you doing, Brian?

00:26:26.225 --> 00:26:29.771
He did the "stare and drive" on you,
didn't he? He got that from me.

00:27:05.139 --> 00:27:07.475
Once we get in here,
you're on your own.

00:27:19.362 --> 00:27:20.780
Look at that one.

00:27:21.197 --> 00:27:24.492
Where'd you get them cars?
At the bottom of a cereal box?

00:27:26.702 --> 00:27:28.746
Real funny, Fonzie.

00:27:30.164 --> 00:27:31.332
Ass.

00:27:31.541 --> 00:27:34.293
Roberto, Enrique,
I need pictures of the drivers...

00:27:34.377 --> 00:27:37.213
their license plates, cars,
and anything else you can find.

00:27:50.268 --> 00:27:51.602
Let's go.

00:27:54.605 --> 00:27:57.358
Keep your mouth shut
and follow my lead, all right?

00:27:57.441 --> 00:28:00.444
- I got this.
- No, I'm serious.

00:28:01.821 --> 00:28:04.198
Handle your business.
I'll handle mine.

00:28:07.910 --> 00:28:09.704
Watch your hands, bruh.

00:28:12.748 --> 00:28:14.083
Go in line.

00:28:14.166 --> 00:28:15.626
Let's go.

00:28:24.802 --> 00:28:25.970
Carter.

00:28:33.519 --> 00:28:35.438
The drivers are here.
Good.

00:28:35.771 --> 00:28:36.939
Come on.

00:28:41.235 --> 00:28:42.320
Stay.

00:28:44.655 --> 00:28:46.699
What's going on here?
Tell me.

00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:50.244
Thank you for coming
on such short notice.

00:28:51.662 --> 00:28:53.789
My red Ferrari was confiscated.

00:28:53.873 --> 00:28:56.417
It sits in an impound lot
in Little Haiti.

00:28:56.792 --> 00:28:58.794
It's about 20 miles from here.

00:28:59.086 --> 00:29:03.215
The car isn't important. The package
I left in the glove box is.

00:29:03.299 --> 00:29:05.718
The first team back here
with the package...

00:29:05.801 --> 00:29:07.887
will have an opportunity
to work for me.

00:29:07.970 --> 00:29:10.139
What are you saying?
We got to audition?

00:29:10.306 --> 00:29:12.350
Nobody has a gun to your head.

00:29:14.769 --> 00:29:16.103
That's it.

00:29:17.021 --> 00:29:19.440
Driver's licenses. Pass them up.

00:29:21.359 --> 00:29:22.693
Before Christmas, guys.

00:29:26.238 --> 00:29:27.573
Let's go!

00:29:47.343 --> 00:29:48.594
Come on, cuz!

00:29:51.847 --> 00:29:53.682
Let's see what this thing can do.

00:30:10.366 --> 00:30:12.993
Agent Markham.
They're heading south on I-95.

00:30:13.077 --> 00:30:14.412
I got it.

00:30:15.037 --> 00:30:17.248
They're running. What a surprise.

00:30:27.925 --> 00:30:29.468
Stick with me, Rome.

00:30:38.394 --> 00:30:40.146
Why must I chase the cat?

00:30:54.493 --> 00:30:55.744
Smart-ass.

00:31:03.419 --> 00:31:05.504
You think you're the bomb, Rome?

00:31:44.543 --> 00:31:46.712
Let's see if you still got it.

00:31:48.672 --> 00:31:50.674
I got something for your ass.

00:31:57.056 --> 00:31:58.390
Watch this, bro.

00:32:07.358 --> 00:32:08.525
Shit.

00:32:09.568 --> 00:32:11.737
How do you like them apples?

00:32:11.987 --> 00:32:13.238
Show-off!

00:32:13.822 --> 00:32:16.784
That's the Brian O'Conner
school of driving, baby!

00:32:21.413 --> 00:32:23.123
Crazy-ass white boy!

00:32:24.166 --> 00:32:25.334
Shit!

00:32:54.238 --> 00:32:55.864
Bumbaclot.

00:32:57.908 --> 00:33:00.035
You better get out
of the street!

00:33:00.119 --> 00:33:01.787
That's some bad shit.

00:33:11.463 --> 00:33:12.756
What do we got?

00:33:15.968 --> 00:33:17.719
That's good. Show me his partner.

00:33:21.807 --> 00:33:23.308
Where are the cars?

00:33:29.731 --> 00:33:31.900
Stinking boats. Where are the cars?

00:33:42.661 --> 00:33:44.830
I need the cars.
Where are the cars at?

00:34:15.235 --> 00:34:17.237
Look in the centre.
What?

00:34:19.907 --> 00:34:21.074
Cha-ching!

00:34:21.408 --> 00:34:23.702
- Now put your blouse back on.
- Hater.

00:34:32.753 --> 00:34:33.921
Shit!

00:34:38.383 --> 00:34:40.260
- Don't let him get away.
- Not a problem.

00:34:40.344 --> 00:34:42.554
Sit on it, Fonzie!

00:34:43.764 --> 00:34:45.057
What the hell?

00:34:45.474 --> 00:34:46.683
Shit. Cops.

00:34:47.392 --> 00:34:48.685
What are they doing here?

00:34:48.727 --> 00:34:50.479
Rome, no!

00:34:53.690 --> 00:34:55.275
Time to go.

00:34:59.571 --> 00:35:00.739
Son of a bitch!

00:35:00.822 --> 00:35:03.992
Juvy record
for popping cars. Two years in J.D.

00:35:04.076 --> 00:35:06.870
Another year for aiding and abetting
an armed robbery.

00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:09.957
He's clean. Dirty, but clean.

00:35:11.875 --> 00:35:12.960
All right.

00:35:33.647 --> 00:35:36.817
Hey, man. You got something
to eat up in there?

00:35:37.609 --> 00:35:38.985
We hungry.

00:35:42.906 --> 00:35:44.783
Sit them by the pool.

00:35:45.575 --> 00:35:47.119
Nice. Come on.

00:35:56.336 --> 00:35:59.881
- What are you checking her out for?
- I'm not checking her out.

00:36:03.969 --> 00:36:06.263
- Yes, you were.
- No, I wasn't.

00:36:07.055 --> 00:36:10.684
- I seen you checking her out.
- Okay, I was. Now shut up.

00:36:10.767 --> 00:36:13.270
You shut up.
Don't tell me to shut up.

00:36:13.353 --> 00:36:16.565
Both you girlies shut up.
Unbelievable.

00:36:27.993 --> 00:36:30.912
You sure are cosy
in this big old mansion.

00:36:33.331 --> 00:36:35.375
Sleeping with the enemy.

00:36:40.922 --> 00:36:42.632
No, no. Sit down.

00:36:43.967 --> 00:36:46.303
Nice Ferrari you got
in the driveway.

00:36:48.472 --> 00:36:50.348
I'm glad you like it.

00:36:54.895 --> 00:36:56.771
Darling, will you hold that?

00:37:05.363 --> 00:37:07.657
We did all that for a damn cigar?

00:37:08.158 --> 00:37:10.493
No. You did that for a job.

00:37:17.250 --> 00:37:21.087
Do you really think that
I would let somebody impound my car?

00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:27.010
The boatyard is mine.

00:37:27.928 --> 00:37:30.263
By the way, you two owe me a gate.

00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:32.515
I'll take it off your cut.

00:37:35.352 --> 00:37:37.145
- Off our cut?
- Yeah.

00:37:38.647 --> 00:37:40.440
I like that.
Good.

00:37:40.899 --> 00:37:43.318
What's this job
you got for us, anyway?

00:37:43.443 --> 00:37:44.611
Come with me.

00:37:44.694 --> 00:37:46.529
The house has ears in it.

00:37:48.657 --> 00:37:52.535
I have something I want you to carry
from North Beach to the Keys.

00:37:52.619 --> 00:37:53.828
What is it?

00:37:53.912 --> 00:37:55.872
Just put it in the car,
drive it to me...

00:37:55.914 --> 00:37:58.708
and don't let anybody
stop you. Understand?

00:37:59.125 --> 00:38:00.710
Any chance of cop trouble?

00:38:00.794 --> 00:38:04.631
I'm buying you a window of time,
but it won't be open very long.

00:38:06.591 --> 00:38:08.134
You make it...

00:38:09.344 --> 00:38:12.639
and I'll personally hand you
$100,000 at the finish line.

00:38:13.139 --> 00:38:15.475
Make it $100,000 apiece.

00:38:17.727 --> 00:38:19.187
Look, man...

00:38:20.021 --> 00:38:21.481
obviously...

00:38:22.899 --> 00:38:24.776
your pockets ain't nervous.

00:38:25.986 --> 00:38:28.405
- Don't ever touch me.
- Ours are empty.

00:38:30.115 --> 00:38:31.658
Like I said...

00:38:32.450 --> 00:38:33.827
we hungry.

00:38:43.795 --> 00:38:48.258
I got an idea. Why don't you boys
join us at the club later tonight?

00:38:48.466 --> 00:38:50.343
Yeah. Pearl at midnight?

00:38:50.427 --> 00:38:53.388
- Get to know each other better.
- Sounds good.

00:38:55.014 --> 00:38:57.058
See you tonight.
See you.

00:39:00.812 --> 00:39:02.147
Hey, you!

00:39:04.899 --> 00:39:07.819
- Your pockets aren't empty.
- Damn.

00:39:08.445 --> 00:39:10.321
I'll take my cutter back.

00:39:17.162 --> 00:39:18.580
Stupid ass.

00:39:20.081 --> 00:39:23.752
Hey, man, I figured you
had 12 or 13 of these.

00:39:23.835 --> 00:39:26.212
You're not too bright.
Get out of here.

00:39:27.130 --> 00:39:30.383
- You're doing the same stupid shit.
- Get off me.

00:39:30.592 --> 00:39:34.471
Look, running your mouth?
Insulting people? Stealing his shit?

00:39:34.846 --> 00:39:37.265
You think I'd let someone
stare me down?

00:39:37.348 --> 00:39:40.101
I didn't let nobody
stare me down in jail, homeboy.

00:39:40.185 --> 00:39:42.729
You think I'm gonna
let it fly on a beach?

00:39:43.438 --> 00:39:46.065
"And you, I'll take my cutter back. "

00:39:46.399 --> 00:39:47.901
His rich ass.

00:39:48.610 --> 00:39:51.237
- And you're packing.
- Like you ain't.

00:39:53.656 --> 00:39:54.949
Exactly.

00:39:55.116 --> 00:39:58.870
- From here on, I do the talking.
- You want to do more than that.

00:39:58.953 --> 00:40:00.371
What does that mean?

00:40:00.455 --> 00:40:04.250
It means you always get in trouble
over a female, Brian.

00:40:15.845 --> 00:40:18.681
Tej's garage is ridiculous.
He has everything.

00:40:18.765 --> 00:40:23.061
Snap-on tools. These lifts are new.
They're only a couple of months old.

00:40:23.144 --> 00:40:25.980
- Jimmy. What's up, man?
- What's up, Bullitt?

00:40:26.064 --> 00:40:27.941
That's Rome there. Do me a favour.

00:40:28.024 --> 00:40:31.653
When you get a second, I want you
to check out the Evo and Spyder.

00:40:31.736 --> 00:40:33.655
Where'd you get an Evo from?

00:40:33.738 --> 00:40:35.990
- It's a long story.
- I got you, man.

00:40:36.074 --> 00:40:37.617
Thanks, Jimmy.

00:40:37.909 --> 00:40:40.912
It's so hot and humid,
I can't even wear drawers.

00:40:40.995 --> 00:40:42.705
Tell me about it.

00:40:43.456 --> 00:40:45.875
Look at all this potential out here.

00:40:45.959 --> 00:40:49.254
Ray, don't do that, man.
You're making me lose money.

00:40:50.421 --> 00:40:53.383
Come on, stop that.
I know you're better than that.

00:40:55.134 --> 00:40:56.302
Damn.

00:41:08.564 --> 00:41:12.318
Your boy can help put that fire out!
Look at the bubble-

00:41:13.486 --> 00:41:14.988
Let's go.
Serious.

00:41:15.071 --> 00:41:16.906
Ray, you're making me
lose money.

00:41:16.990 --> 00:41:19.575
Don't do that.
Don't do that to me, now.

00:41:19.659 --> 00:41:21.202
Come on, Ray. Do it.

00:41:21.869 --> 00:41:25.039
Tej Parker? This is Roman Pearce.

00:41:27.291 --> 00:41:31.587
Basically, he's the man to know in
Miami. Has his finger in everything.

00:41:31.754 --> 00:41:33.673
It's just the way it is.

00:41:33.881 --> 00:41:35.717
- What's going on?
- What's up?

00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:37.301
- How you doing?
- Good.

00:41:37.385 --> 00:41:39.137
What's this?
What's the latest?

00:41:40.847 --> 00:41:43.266
It's a work in progress.
It's not finished.

00:41:43.349 --> 00:41:46.102
That's some artistic shit.
You got talent.

00:41:46.185 --> 00:41:49.814
Ray, it's do or die now!
Bring it home, Ray!

00:41:51.065 --> 00:41:52.483
Yeah, baby!

00:41:52.775 --> 00:41:54.444
Pay up! Pay up!

00:41:55.903 --> 00:41:57.697
That's how they do it out here?

00:41:57.780 --> 00:41:59.949
- Every day.
- That's crazy.

00:42:00.033 --> 00:42:03.286
Right here. Right now.
You don't look too happy.

00:42:03.703 --> 00:42:07.832
Expeditiously, man. I need it quick.
Thank you. Thank you.

00:42:08.124 --> 00:42:11.961
How you feeling, man?
You all right? Thank you.

00:42:13.588 --> 00:42:15.047
Not too bad.

00:42:17.258 --> 00:42:20.720
I see you're about your money,
homey. You race, too?

00:42:22.263 --> 00:42:26.434
No, man. I hit a wall doing
like a buck 20 a couple years ago.

00:42:26.726 --> 00:42:29.645
Ever since then, I've just been
organising and collecting.

00:42:29.729 --> 00:42:33.608
Check it out. He'll be in town
a while. Can he use that cot?

00:42:35.067 --> 00:42:37.153
What's wrong with your place?

00:42:38.279 --> 00:42:41.282
I don't want to stay with him.
He has bad habits.

00:42:42.867 --> 00:42:46.662
All right. Show him around.
I'll be up there in a minute.

00:42:46.746 --> 00:42:48.080
- Thanks.
- Sure.

00:42:49.290 --> 00:42:51.876
Who wants a chance
to win their money back?

00:42:52.710 --> 00:42:56.005
So, Jimmy? You ever seen
anything like this before?

00:42:56.214 --> 00:42:59.592
No. Both of them
are wired like I never seen before.

00:42:59.675 --> 00:43:00.843
What?

00:43:00.927 --> 00:43:02.720
They got us wired with GPS.

00:43:02.803 --> 00:43:05.848
That's why Markham knew
we were at that impound lot.

00:43:06.641 --> 00:43:10.186
You the master mechanic.
Can't you just yank that shit out?

00:43:10.436 --> 00:43:12.730
I'll try, but this ain't LoJack.

00:43:12.855 --> 00:43:16.817
The DIS box, the engine management
system, the main harness...

00:43:16.984 --> 00:43:18.903
The GPS is spidered into all that.

00:43:18.986 --> 00:43:20.530
Tell me something, man.

00:43:20.655 --> 00:43:23.115
Do I even want to know
where the Skyline is, dawg?

00:43:23.199 --> 00:43:26.953
Or where you've been or where
the hell you got these rides from?

00:43:27.620 --> 00:43:29.622
- They're hot.
- Yeah, they hot.

00:43:29.705 --> 00:43:33.834
Wired so hot, anyone tracking them
knows if you wear your seat belt.

00:43:37.004 --> 00:43:38.339
All right, Jimmy.

00:43:38.422 --> 00:43:40.883
- Just do what you can do, bro.
- I got you.

00:43:40.967 --> 00:43:42.301
Thanks, man.

00:43:42.468 --> 00:43:45.054
We need to get these
on the street ASAP.

00:43:46.264 --> 00:43:47.765
Check it out.

00:43:48.057 --> 00:43:50.685
See that Cadillac across the street?

00:43:55.523 --> 00:43:58.401
They've been on us
since we left Verone's house.

00:44:08.286 --> 00:44:11.622
Elian and Fidel!

00:44:12.790 --> 00:44:14.750
Can I clean your windshield?

00:44:14.834 --> 00:44:16.669
What are you doing, man?

00:44:19.297 --> 00:44:20.840
Is everything copastetic?

00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:24.468
Kiss my ass.

00:44:26.012 --> 00:44:27.179
Shit.

00:44:30.099 --> 00:44:31.434
Let's go!

00:44:37.148 --> 00:44:39.942
He'll blow our cover
before we even get started.

00:44:40.276 --> 00:44:43.529
- What went wrong?
- That's what I want to know.

00:44:43.612 --> 00:44:45.740
Show me your hands.
Keep them up!

00:44:45.823 --> 00:44:47.950
- What's this about?
- What's going on?

00:44:48.034 --> 00:44:51.412
Hold this. You think you can
shoot at me? I'm a federal agent.

00:44:51.495 --> 00:44:52.621
What are you talking about?

00:44:52.705 --> 00:44:55.708
Get your damn hands off me!
Get him away from me, dawg!

00:44:55.791 --> 00:44:58.961
'Cause you wear a badge doesn't mean
you can mess shit up for us!

00:44:59.045 --> 00:45:00.755
Get your hands off me!

00:45:00.838 --> 00:45:02.965
- Lucky I didn't shoot you!
- Shut up!

00:45:03.049 --> 00:45:04.717
Don't tell me to shut up!

00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:07.136
You almost blew our cover, old man!

00:45:07.219 --> 00:45:09.263
You shouldn't have shown up
like you did.

00:45:09.346 --> 00:45:11.348
You didn't know
Verone was testing us?

00:45:11.432 --> 00:45:13.559
I thought you punks were running!

00:45:13.642 --> 00:45:15.936
That's great. That's real great!

00:45:16.020 --> 00:45:19.857
And if Rome wanted to shoot you?
You wouldn't be here right now.

00:45:20.441 --> 00:45:22.735
We got to get this under control.

00:45:27.698 --> 00:45:29.158
That's mine!

00:45:29.325 --> 00:45:30.493
So?

00:45:31.452 --> 00:45:35.080
- Tell me what you know.
- We're making a run for Verone.

00:45:35.164 --> 00:45:36.999
I'm not sure when or where...

00:45:37.082 --> 00:45:40.503
but he said he bought us a window,
I assume from the local cops.

00:45:40.586 --> 00:45:43.088
I can talk to some guys
at the local P.D.

00:45:43.422 --> 00:45:46.258
No good. If Verone has some
of them on payroll...

00:45:46.342 --> 00:45:48.594
we can't let
them know our operation.

00:45:48.677 --> 00:45:49.970
Exactly.

00:45:50.346 --> 00:45:54.475
In addition, Verone told us that
he himself will be at the drop.

00:45:54.642 --> 00:45:56.352
That's good news.

00:45:56.685 --> 00:46:00.481
If you're delivering drug money,
we can get him for laundering.

00:46:00.648 --> 00:46:02.983
- Now, there's only one problem.
- What's that?

00:46:03.067 --> 00:46:04.360
Fuentes.

00:46:04.693 --> 00:46:06.862
- Verone's tapping her.
- Tapping her?

00:46:07.196 --> 00:46:09.281
- Tapping her how?
- That is crap.

00:46:09.365 --> 00:46:11.742
What you talking about?
We know what we seen.

00:46:11.826 --> 00:46:15.955
What do you think, O'Conner?
She's compromised? You should know.

00:46:16.372 --> 00:46:19.750
- What does that mean?
- Your pal O'Conner didn't tell you?

00:46:19.834 --> 00:46:21.877
He flipped on Bilkins in L.A.

00:46:21.961 --> 00:46:24.880
He gave his mark his car keys
and let him disappear.

00:46:24.964 --> 00:46:27.299
That's why he's not a cop anymore.

00:46:29.426 --> 00:46:31.720
So what do you think, expert?

00:46:32.972 --> 00:46:34.223
I don't know.

00:46:34.306 --> 00:46:36.642
All right. We'll keep an eye on her.

00:46:38.143 --> 00:46:39.895
We're out of here.

00:46:46.694 --> 00:46:48.362
Let your man go?

00:46:48.904 --> 00:46:50.739
Drop it.
I don't wanna talk about it.

00:46:50.823 --> 00:46:53.701
Drop it, hell.
I want to hear about this, homey.

00:46:53.951 --> 00:46:55.786
Forget about it, cuz.

00:46:55.869 --> 00:46:57.997
We got Fuentes in with Verone...

00:46:58.789 --> 00:47:00.749
Markham trying to blow our cover...

00:47:00.833 --> 00:47:04.920
and we got two wired cars no better
than that ankle bracelet of mine.

00:47:05.004 --> 00:47:09.133
I'll tell you, bruh, you let Markham
do that again in front of Verone...

00:47:09.216 --> 00:47:10.593
that'll be our ass!

00:47:10.676 --> 00:47:12.886
I know, man.
It's getting thick real quick.

00:47:12.970 --> 00:47:15.723
We need a way out, got to
come up with an exit strategy.

00:47:15.806 --> 00:47:17.683
- Exit strategy?
- Yeah.

00:47:20.561 --> 00:47:23.022
I like the way that sounds.
What you got in mind?

00:47:23.105 --> 00:47:26.150
I don't know.
But we need two more cars.

00:47:33.949 --> 00:47:35.534
Here they come.

00:47:54.678 --> 00:47:57.931
Fonzie and Fabio.
Glad you could join us.

00:47:58.932 --> 00:48:01.935
We hear you want to get rid
of those Cracker Jack toys.

00:48:02.019 --> 00:48:03.520
No, we figured your cars...

00:48:03.604 --> 00:48:06.774
deserve better drivers,
so we'll take them off your hands.

00:48:06.857 --> 00:48:08.400
Why don't we settle this now?

00:48:08.484 --> 00:48:11.278
Wait. How about we settle
this on the blacktop?

00:48:11.612 --> 00:48:15.407
Each car does a down-and-back,
tag-team style. For slips.

00:48:15.616 --> 00:48:17.117
Loser walks home.

00:48:17.201 --> 00:48:19.828
- We came to race.
- Load them up then.

00:48:23.582 --> 00:48:25.501
Let's get these cars.

00:48:27.336 --> 00:48:30.881
Check it out. There's no way
we'll beat these guys straight up.

00:48:30.964 --> 00:48:33.383
That Hemi's putting out about 425...

00:48:33.509 --> 00:48:36.845
and that Yenko will snap
a speedo in five seconds flat.

00:48:37.513 --> 00:48:39.640
We have to pull something
out of our ass.

00:48:39.723 --> 00:48:43.060
I think we should save
the spray for the way back.

00:48:43.769 --> 00:48:46.063
Done deal.
Let's do this, bro.

00:48:46.230 --> 00:48:48.482
I'm getting that orange one.

00:48:50.484 --> 00:48:52.528
You ain't ready, Fabio!

00:48:56.865 --> 00:48:57.991
All right.

00:48:58.116 --> 00:49:01.495
You each got a barrel to go around
down at the end of the road.

00:49:01.870 --> 00:49:05.457
Second wave's got to sit tight till
your partner crosses this line here.

00:49:05.541 --> 00:49:08.585
First team to go down and back twice
wins the race.

00:49:08.919 --> 00:49:10.671
At which point...

00:49:11.880 --> 00:49:15.425
the losers will hand over them keys.

00:49:15.509 --> 00:49:19.012
Or you'll be eating breakfast
through straws from now on.

00:49:22.432 --> 00:49:23.767
I get it.

00:49:25.310 --> 00:49:27.187
This means you, too.

00:49:28.021 --> 00:49:29.189
I got it.

00:49:29.273 --> 00:49:31.358
All right. Let's race.

00:49:35.654 --> 00:49:38.949
Come on, baby, you got this, Rome!
This dude ain't serious.

00:49:39.032 --> 00:49:42.494
Yeah, you gone, homey.
I got this. This is done.

00:49:44.079 --> 00:49:45.539
You about to lose your car.

00:49:45.622 --> 00:49:47.749
- Do it, Rome!
- Come on, you got it, man.

00:49:47.833 --> 00:49:52.045
Think I'm worried about this fool?
This is nothing!

00:50:02.764 --> 00:50:04.975
- Oh, no.
- American muscle.

00:50:07.728 --> 00:50:10.564
Your engine ain't as big
as your mouth.

00:50:15.736 --> 00:50:18.405
Got to smoke him.

00:50:18.488 --> 00:50:19.823
All right, here we go!

00:50:19.906 --> 00:50:22.909
- It's all right, I'll handle this.
- Handle it.

00:50:23.827 --> 00:50:26.788
Ready, and... go!

00:50:33.253 --> 00:50:36.048
You ain't ready!
I run these streets!

00:50:45.682 --> 00:50:48.268
Romey Rome! You ain't heard of me?

00:51:06.161 --> 00:51:07.496
Oh, shit.

00:51:12.250 --> 00:51:13.627
Oh, yeah!

00:51:18.590 --> 00:51:20.342
I'm gonna get you.

00:51:22.427 --> 00:51:24.137
Where's your big mouth now?

00:51:24.221 --> 00:51:26.556
That car's going home with me.

00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:39.653
Shit. Eat this, sucker!

00:51:53.834 --> 00:51:55.001
Shit!

00:51:59.297 --> 00:52:01.800
Yeah, boy! Go, Korpi!

00:52:05.011 --> 00:52:07.931
Sorry, blondie,
how does that dust taste?

00:52:10.350 --> 00:52:11.852
I don't know.

00:52:12.853 --> 00:52:14.396
Come on, Rome.

00:52:42.883 --> 00:52:44.175
What the...

00:52:44.259 --> 00:52:47.304
Good move, kid.
Let's see if you got the balls.

00:53:10.452 --> 00:53:11.786
Shit, come on.

00:53:21.755 --> 00:53:23.965
Come on, Brian, bring it home, man!

00:54:06.508 --> 00:54:08.343
We got two new cars!

00:54:09.844 --> 00:54:11.012
Damn!

00:54:18.269 --> 00:54:21.147
Y'all ain't ready!
Get to walking, Fabio!

00:54:22.607 --> 00:54:24.609
Use them bus tokens!

00:54:32.242 --> 00:54:34.244
How are you?
What's your name?

00:54:34.327 --> 00:54:35.703
We're Mr. Verone's guests.

00:54:46.047 --> 00:54:47.966
It's a hoasis in here.

00:54:48.466 --> 00:54:50.969
Yeah, lots of potential.

00:54:52.804 --> 00:54:55.098
Damn. You got a pen?

00:54:58.268 --> 00:55:00.395
It's about to get serious.

00:55:01.104 --> 00:55:03.565
Look at that girl on the swing.

00:55:03.648 --> 00:55:07.777
You guys did something right.
He never socialises with hired help.

00:55:07.861 --> 00:55:09.946
Now what's that make you?

00:55:10.405 --> 00:55:12.740
- Where's he at?
- He's on his way.

00:55:12.824 --> 00:55:14.993
You and Verone
don't go everywhere together?

00:55:15.076 --> 00:55:17.871
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.

00:55:21.040 --> 00:55:24.002
- I'm gonna go take a piss.
- You go do that.

00:55:28.423 --> 00:55:30.133
What is his deal?

00:55:30.508 --> 00:55:32.635
He doesn't trust people
who carry badges.

00:55:32.719 --> 00:55:34.721
You talk like you know.

00:55:37.265 --> 00:55:41.769
I'd been a cop about two months when
Roman was busted in a garage raid.

00:55:42.061 --> 00:55:45.732
He had eight sets of wheels
in his possession, each of them hot.

00:55:45.815 --> 00:55:47.567
So you busted him?

00:55:47.650 --> 00:55:51.779
I didn't know it was going down.
But that doesn't really matter.

00:55:53.364 --> 00:55:58.036
Once I became a cop, Roman saw me
as a friend who became the enemy.

00:56:04.459 --> 00:56:07.086
Is there anything I can get for you,
Mr. Verone?

00:56:07.170 --> 00:56:09.213
Just tell them
to come join me.

00:56:16.137 --> 00:56:17.972
I was admiring this.

00:56:27.815 --> 00:56:28.983
Damn.

00:56:29.400 --> 00:56:32.236
I'm not giving it to you. What's up?

00:56:32.320 --> 00:56:33.696
He's here.

00:56:34.197 --> 00:56:35.740
Where's he at?

00:56:35.990 --> 00:56:37.533
He's over there. Don't look.

00:56:41.579 --> 00:56:44.666
Excuse me, Mr. Verone
would like for you to join him.

00:56:45.208 --> 00:56:46.668
Let's do it.

00:56:47.210 --> 00:56:49.379
See what I'm talking about?

00:56:52.715 --> 00:56:54.634
It's all right, let them in.

00:56:57.220 --> 00:56:59.430
Go sit down,
I'll talk to you in a second.

00:57:00.640 --> 00:57:02.850
- How you doing?
- Good. Enjoying your night?

00:57:02.934 --> 00:57:05.269
- Yeah, I'm having a good time.
- Good.

00:57:07.522 --> 00:57:09.399
She's beautiful, isn't she?

00:57:16.155 --> 00:57:17.323
Yeah.

00:57:18.199 --> 00:57:19.784
She's gorgeous.

00:57:26.374 --> 00:57:28.167
You got balls, kid.

00:57:29.210 --> 00:57:30.962
I appreciate that.

00:57:31.921 --> 00:57:34.090
Women are a powerful force.

00:57:35.716 --> 00:57:39.345
You see the blonde sitting
with the gentleman right here?

00:57:43.349 --> 00:57:47.603
Five minutes of her time, and she
can get anything she wants from him.

00:57:47.895 --> 00:57:49.522
I love your hair.

00:57:49.605 --> 00:57:50.815
Watch.

00:57:56.946 --> 00:57:59.657
I wonder where they're going?
Sit down.

00:58:01.909 --> 00:58:05.288
So you lit my man's car on fire.
Is that right?

00:58:07.081 --> 00:58:08.249
Yeah.

00:58:09.292 --> 00:58:10.501
I did.

00:58:12.378 --> 00:58:15.506
I got a problem with authority.

00:58:17.800 --> 00:58:19.844
I have that same problem.

00:58:20.386 --> 00:58:24.182
For me, it's cops in particular.

00:58:36.444 --> 00:58:38.321
Let's take a walk. Come on.

00:58:38.404 --> 00:58:41.324
We just got here.
And now we're leaving.

00:58:42.200 --> 00:58:43.534
Let's go.

00:58:51.667 --> 00:58:52.710
Hey.

00:58:52.793 --> 00:58:53.920
Come on.

00:59:16.484 --> 00:59:18.152
What's all that?

00:59:20.363 --> 00:59:22.865
We're going to have a little fun.

00:59:29.622 --> 00:59:30.998
Thank you.

00:59:31.749 --> 00:59:36.170
- It'll be fun. Let's stay longer.
- Yeah.

00:59:39.382 --> 00:59:40.633
Hey, Carter.

00:59:41.092 --> 00:59:43.177
Meet Detective Whitworth.

00:59:45.304 --> 00:59:47.223
One of Miami's finest.

00:59:48.057 --> 00:59:49.892
Thank you, sweetheart.

00:59:49.976 --> 00:59:51.769
You enjoying yourself, Detective?

00:59:51.852 --> 00:59:53.312
Yeah, I was.

00:59:54.146 --> 00:59:56.399
I mean, you know me.

00:59:56.774 --> 00:59:57.942
Yeah.

00:59:58.526 --> 01:00:00.069
I do know you.

01:00:01.779 --> 01:00:03.781
You've been on my payroll
a long time.

01:00:03.864 --> 01:00:06.450
- Verone, that ain't right.
- Shut up.

01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:11.122
I've got one last job for you.
You hear me?

01:00:11.205 --> 01:00:13.624
- We've been through this.
- Yeah?

01:00:13.958 --> 01:00:15.835
And I said I can't do it.

01:00:17.461 --> 01:00:20.047
That's the wrong answer.
The table.

01:00:25.678 --> 01:00:27.680
I'm a detective, Verone!

01:00:27.763 --> 01:00:31.851
You do anything to me, the whole
force'll be on your ass in a minute.

01:00:31.934 --> 01:00:35.062
Shut your mouth,
you fat piece of shit.

01:00:35.938 --> 01:00:37.523
Stop right now.

01:00:43.738 --> 01:00:45.281
What the hell?

01:00:45.489 --> 01:00:46.824
Sit down.

01:00:47.450 --> 01:00:50.202
You're going to regret this.
Stop right now!

01:00:50.286 --> 01:00:52.830
Once the bucket
gets hot enough, Detective...

01:00:52.913 --> 01:00:55.624
the rat is gonna want out.

01:00:57.418 --> 01:01:00.254
And the only direction it can go,
is south.

01:01:04.425 --> 01:01:05.801
Hold that.

01:01:06.302 --> 01:01:07.845
Get it off me!

01:01:07.970 --> 01:01:09.054
I'll forget it-

01:01:09.138 --> 01:01:10.431
Shut up.

01:01:11.307 --> 01:01:15.978
Did you know that your average rat
can chew through a steel drainpipe?

01:01:17.313 --> 01:01:20.566
You have nothing to worry about
when he's screaming.

01:01:20.649 --> 01:01:23.402
It's when he goes quiet
that he goes to work.

01:01:23.486 --> 01:01:25.154
Stop it!

01:01:26.489 --> 01:01:29.867
You can't be this stupid!
Stop it now!

01:01:29.950 --> 01:01:33.454
You're in charge of the units
that are watching my properties.

01:01:34.038 --> 01:01:36.540
What I want is a 15-minute window...

01:01:36.624 --> 01:01:39.335
where everybody,
and I mean everybody, disappears.

01:01:39.418 --> 01:01:41.921
- I can't do it!
- You can't?

01:01:44.006 --> 01:01:45.299
Stop it.

01:01:45.382 --> 01:01:47.676
Okay. Monica, come here.

01:01:48.010 --> 01:01:49.261
Help!

01:01:50.304 --> 01:01:51.764
Shut him up.

01:01:52.973 --> 01:01:54.642
Help!

01:02:00.814 --> 01:02:02.274
It's biting me!

01:02:03.984 --> 01:02:05.152
What?

01:02:07.154 --> 01:02:09.156
Got something you want to say?

01:02:10.783 --> 01:02:12.826
It bit me. Jesus.

01:02:13.953 --> 01:02:16.247
- I'll do it!
- Do what? Say it.

01:02:16.330 --> 01:02:19.083
I'll do it.
I'll give you your window.

01:02:20.292 --> 01:02:21.961
Just get it off me.

01:02:22.044 --> 01:02:23.462
Get it off!

01:02:25.547 --> 01:02:27.216
You betray me...

01:02:27.925 --> 01:02:29.718
and my rat here...

01:02:30.594 --> 01:02:33.180
is gonna visit your wife, Lynn...

01:02:33.597 --> 01:02:36.225
your son, Clay,
and your daughter, Lexi.

01:02:36.308 --> 01:02:38.894
Do you hear me?
Do you understand me?

01:02:39.228 --> 01:02:41.021
- Hear me?
- Get it off.

01:02:41.105 --> 01:02:44.108
I'll burn your fucking eyes out!
I'll burn them out.

01:02:47.611 --> 01:02:49.530
Now, you can go.

01:02:50.447 --> 01:02:53.117
Get rid of him. Let's go.
Get it off.

01:03:02.626 --> 01:03:04.461
You boys enjoy the show?

01:03:05.087 --> 01:03:08.716
Fifteen minutes, and then every cop
in Florida's gonna be on you.

01:03:08.799 --> 01:03:12.761
Be at Versailles Caf├¿ at 6:00 a.m,
day after tomorrow, ready to drive.

01:03:12.845 --> 01:03:14.805
- You understand?
- Yeah.

01:03:14.930 --> 01:03:16.890
Don't play games with me...

01:03:17.433 --> 01:03:19.852
or you'll be next. All right?

01:03:20.477 --> 01:03:23.397
Help yourself to a little champagne.
Let's go.

01:03:26.483 --> 01:03:28.318
That was a damn rat.

01:03:37.995 --> 01:03:42.499
You ever touch another man again,
and I'll kill you.

01:03:42.708 --> 01:03:44.168
You hear me?

01:03:45.794 --> 01:03:47.838
Look at me. You hear me?

01:03:55.137 --> 01:03:57.765
She was into it.
What's that about?

01:03:58.348 --> 01:04:00.934
You seen the way she grabbed
the dude's head.

01:04:01.018 --> 01:04:05.522
She had to. He was testing her.
Her ass is on the line, like ours.

01:04:06.398 --> 01:04:08.484
You're feeling this girl
way too much.

01:04:08.567 --> 01:04:12.237
She's like that trailer rat
from back in the day, Tanya.

01:04:12.321 --> 01:04:15.449
Tanya? Man, you went out with her
after I did.

01:04:16.700 --> 01:04:18.744
I couldn't let it go to waste.

01:04:18.827 --> 01:04:20.204
I got you.

01:04:20.787 --> 01:04:22.289
Is that right?

01:04:22.372 --> 01:04:25.292
We go race for cash,
but when I step on the gas...

01:04:25.375 --> 01:04:28.545
my nitrous go blast,
leave your ass in the past.

01:04:28.629 --> 01:04:30.881
Tej, you about
to lose your garage.

01:04:30.964 --> 01:04:32.382
Whatever, man.

01:04:32.466 --> 01:04:35.135
I'm a low-budget mechanic,
but I overcharge.

01:04:35.219 --> 01:04:38.013
Pay me! Let's go, man.

01:04:38.305 --> 01:04:39.973
Pay me my money.

01:04:40.057 --> 01:04:43.185
I'm glad you're happy.
This is my garage.

01:04:43.810 --> 01:04:46.188
Royal flush. Give me this, man.

01:04:46.647 --> 01:04:48.106
Talk to him.

01:04:48.273 --> 01:04:52.819
Put that money back on the table.
You know it's mine next hand.

01:04:52.903 --> 01:04:56.949
Jimmy, how're you gonna pay me back
if you keep losing to Tej like that?

01:04:57.199 --> 01:05:00.202
I'm going to crash, Tej.
I'll catch you tomorrow.

01:05:16.593 --> 01:05:17.928
What are you doing here?

01:05:18.011 --> 01:05:21.890
They're gonna kill you. I heard him
telling Enrique and Roberto.

01:05:21.974 --> 01:05:25.102
Once you finish the run, they're
putting a bullet in your head.

01:05:25.435 --> 01:05:27.271
You sure you heard him right?

01:05:27.521 --> 01:05:28.563
I'm sure.

01:05:36.154 --> 01:05:38.240
Verone's boys is outside...

01:05:38.782 --> 01:05:42.703
I see what they're looking for.
Your little girlfriend here.

01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:50.460
- They don't know. I snuck out.
- What are they doing here then?

01:05:50.544 --> 01:05:52.546
I don't know.
Maybe they're guessing.

01:05:53.005 --> 01:05:55.507
Go stall them for,
like, two minutes.

01:05:55.590 --> 01:05:57.551
Check her, homey.

01:06:02.723 --> 01:06:05.058
Found what you're
looking for?

01:06:09.438 --> 01:06:12.065
Hey, buddy. Hi, guys. How you doing?

01:06:13.942 --> 01:06:16.069
Y'all still mad about y'all car?

01:06:16.153 --> 01:06:19.072
Don't even trip.
Come on, man, can't you take a joke?

01:06:19.948 --> 01:06:23.035
This isn't about being a good cop
or doing your job.

01:06:23.118 --> 01:06:25.162
They're gonna kill you.
You gotta pull out.

01:06:25.245 --> 01:06:27.497
Verone pay you
to keep a straight face like that?

01:06:27.581 --> 01:06:31.585
'Cause if I was making money,
I'd remove that mole off my nose.

01:06:31.668 --> 01:06:33.670
- Okay?
- Yeah.

01:06:33.754 --> 01:06:35.922
How much he pay y'all anyway?

01:06:36.006 --> 01:06:39.551
Every time I see y'all,
y'all got the silk shirts on...

01:06:39.634 --> 01:06:41.887
jewellery, looking real Miami.

01:06:42.387 --> 01:06:46.933
I caught you walking up in the club,
the hamburger meat all hanging out.

01:06:48.852 --> 01:06:51.396
Don't make that run, Brian.

01:06:52.230 --> 01:06:53.648
Be careful.

01:07:07.370 --> 01:07:10.499
Where are you going?
You stay right here with us, buddy.

01:07:19.424 --> 01:07:21.259
Don't even think about it.

01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:36.399
Stay your ass off my homeboy's boat.

01:07:43.281 --> 01:07:46.076
Put the gun down now!

01:07:46.368 --> 01:07:48.078
You first, asshole!

01:07:48.161 --> 01:07:49.996
I'll shoot the shit out of him!

01:07:55.293 --> 01:08:00.006
Put down the gun!

01:08:00.966 --> 01:08:02.592
Enough.

01:08:02.968 --> 01:08:04.844
Shut up.

01:08:06.555 --> 01:08:08.348
It's over. Come on.

01:08:08.848 --> 01:08:10.392
It's over. Let's go.

01:08:11.393 --> 01:08:13.687
It's our gun. Come on, let's go.

01:08:18.984 --> 01:08:21.695
I'm glad to see you boys
are getting along so well...

01:08:21.778 --> 01:08:26.533
because tomorrow, Roberto and
Enrique'll be riding along with you.

01:08:26.992 --> 01:08:29.077
Just so we don't have any problems.

01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:31.079
I'll see you guys in a bit.

01:08:34.958 --> 01:08:37.085
What the hell
was she doing in there?

01:08:47.846 --> 01:08:50.098
Where'd you go this morning?

01:08:50.223 --> 01:08:52.767
I went to breakfast
with some friends.

01:08:58.481 --> 01:08:59.983
With friends?

01:09:01.943 --> 01:09:04.070
I do have friends, Carter.

01:09:10.744 --> 01:09:11.911
Okay.

01:09:13.913 --> 01:09:15.457
I'll see you later.

01:09:24.799 --> 01:09:26.217
Nice shirt, Bilkins.

01:09:26.301 --> 01:09:27.969
It's my day off.

01:09:30.055 --> 01:09:31.765
Well, anyhow, this is the deal.

01:09:32.307 --> 01:09:35.643
Last night, Verone threatened a cop
into giving us a window.

01:09:35.727 --> 01:09:39.022
We're driving to an airstrip
in the Keys, off Nallwood Avenue.

01:09:39.105 --> 01:09:41.733
Verone has a plane there
and he's taking off for good.

01:09:41.816 --> 01:09:43.693
Wait a minute. How do you know this?

01:09:43.985 --> 01:09:45.236
Monica.

01:09:45.653 --> 01:09:48.448
She's doing her job. She warned us.

01:09:48.531 --> 01:09:49.991
She warned you about what?

01:09:50.075 --> 01:09:52.535
Verone plans to kill us
after we give him the money.

01:09:52.619 --> 01:09:55.997
Driving into an ambush
wasn't the deal. I'm calling it off.

01:09:56.081 --> 01:09:59.417
Like hell you are.
This is a Customs case, Bilkins.

01:09:59.501 --> 01:10:01.669
No one's calling this off
unless I do.

01:10:01.753 --> 01:10:03.588
Look, this is real simple.

01:10:04.130 --> 01:10:08.468
Make the run, get Verone and his
cash together, so I can move in.

01:10:08.551 --> 01:10:11.763
You don't, I'll file enough charges
on you to make you disappear.

01:10:11.846 --> 01:10:13.264
Take these.

01:10:13.348 --> 01:10:16.768
We're gonna have GPS on you
so you don't get any cute ideas.

01:10:16.851 --> 01:10:19.020
And to make sure
nothing happens to them, right?

01:10:19.103 --> 01:10:20.563
Yeah, right.

01:10:29.405 --> 01:10:31.157
That guy's a dick.

01:10:34.202 --> 01:10:36.162
Let me get this right.

01:10:36.538 --> 01:10:39.123
If we don't do this,
then we go to jail.

01:10:39.499 --> 01:10:42.460
But if we do it,
then Verone's going to kill us.

01:10:42.627 --> 01:10:45.713
- It's a hell of a deal, huh?
- Yeah.

01:10:47.298 --> 01:10:48.758
Maybe it is.

01:10:50.301 --> 01:10:54.639
This guy's got an ass full of loot
that he's ready to dump in our cars.

01:10:54.973 --> 01:10:59.143
I can think of two reasons why
he doesn't need that money anymore.

01:10:59.227 --> 01:11:00.603
Here we go.

01:11:00.687 --> 01:11:02.105
You and me.

01:11:02.313 --> 01:11:03.940
Just like the old days.

01:11:04.023 --> 01:11:08.319
- What do you think?
- They messed with the wrong guys.

01:11:11.447 --> 01:11:13.658
- Tej, what's up, bro?
- What's up?

01:11:13.741 --> 01:11:15.368
How quickly can you organise?

01:11:15.451 --> 01:11:18.246
Look, if y'all really want
to carry out this plan...

01:11:18.329 --> 01:11:21.791
this is the best place to do it.
What do y'all think?

01:11:21.874 --> 01:11:24.460
I think it's perfect.
So, what do they store here?

01:11:30.466 --> 01:11:31.801
This thing is clean.

01:11:31.884 --> 01:11:33.094
Distributor cap.

01:11:47.775 --> 01:11:52.613
Jimmy, do we have any half-empty
bottles of nitrous lying around?

01:11:52.697 --> 01:11:54.782
Sure, but I've already
loaded you for spray.

01:11:54.866 --> 01:11:57.535
I'm thinking we may need it
for something else...

01:11:57.618 --> 01:12:00.413
'cause our cars may get
a little crowded, you know?

01:12:08.755 --> 01:12:11.299
When did you start eating so much?

01:12:12.300 --> 01:12:14.177
I was in jail, bruh.

01:12:14.510 --> 01:12:17.347
I know how shitty the grub is
on the inside.

01:12:18.473 --> 01:12:21.100
The way things are shaping up
out here right now...

01:12:21.184 --> 01:12:24.395
it'll be a matter of time
before I'm back in there, or dead.

01:12:25.897 --> 01:12:28.900
So I'm trying to eat all I can
while I can.

01:12:30.526 --> 01:12:33.821
Plus, the doctor tells me
I got a high metabolism.

01:12:38.534 --> 01:12:40.536
You remember us growing up?

01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:43.414
Playing football in the dirt?

01:12:44.290 --> 01:12:47.710
Getting into trouble.
All the stupid things we did?

01:12:48.920 --> 01:12:51.923
When you got busted,
whether I was a cop or not...

01:12:52.006 --> 01:12:54.258
if there was anything
I could have done...

01:12:55.134 --> 01:12:57.011
I would have done it.

01:12:57.595 --> 01:12:59.764
I just want you to know that.

01:13:00.389 --> 01:13:02.892
Is that why
you let that dude go in L.A.?

01:13:05.144 --> 01:13:07.855
Yeah, I think
that had a lot to do with it.

01:13:10.108 --> 01:13:11.943
When I got busted...

01:13:12.527 --> 01:13:13.694
it wasn't your fault.

01:13:14.904 --> 01:13:18.199
It was all on me, Mr. Roman Pearce.

01:13:18.783 --> 01:13:20.827
Wild and out. Crazy man.

01:13:21.869 --> 01:13:24.038
No one could tell me nothing.

01:13:24.122 --> 01:13:25.581
Riding solo.

01:13:26.207 --> 01:13:27.667
Yeah, well, not anymore.

01:13:33.422 --> 01:13:35.132
Not anymore, bro.

01:14:00.491 --> 01:14:02.785
I've got Verone's Navigator
leaving the residence.

01:14:02.869 --> 01:14:04.036
Copy.

01:14:04.745 --> 01:14:07.248
Sir, we've got Verone on the move
to the airstrip.

01:14:07.331 --> 01:14:10.126
Let's get a bird in the air.
Tell him to keep his distance.

01:14:12.753 --> 01:14:14.213
- Ready.
- Thanks.

01:14:15.923 --> 01:14:17.967
- You're all set.
- Thanks.

01:14:18.551 --> 01:14:21.220
- All set?
- Yeah. Let's do it.

01:14:24.307 --> 01:14:25.558
Report.

01:14:27.810 --> 01:14:29.937
What's going on
out there?

01:14:31.564 --> 01:14:32.773
Team One, checking in.

01:14:32.857 --> 01:14:35.568
- Team Two, checking in.
- Team Three, checking in.

01:14:35.651 --> 01:14:37.820
Team Four,
all clear here, too.

01:14:38.362 --> 01:14:40.281
Team Five, checking in.

01:14:41.073 --> 01:14:42.908
Team Six, all clear.

01:14:48.331 --> 01:14:51.042
- Here we go.
- Yeah, so you know what to do.

01:14:51.125 --> 01:14:53.169
Stay cool. Keep focused.

01:14:53.544 --> 01:14:56.130
Remember the airstrip's
off Nallwood Avenue.

01:14:56.213 --> 01:14:58.466
It's the third exit
after the bridge.

01:15:00.134 --> 01:15:01.385
Got it.

01:15:01.510 --> 01:15:03.429
You ready for this?

01:15:03.512 --> 01:15:07.141
Come on, man.
Guns, murderers, and crooked cops?

01:15:07.308 --> 01:15:09.060
I was made for this, bruh!

01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:46.013
Come on.

01:16:09.620 --> 01:16:12.623
I got activity
at Verone's trailer property.

01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:15.918
Do not move an inch
until I tell you to!

01:16:40.901 --> 01:16:42.194
Load up.

01:16:45.030 --> 01:16:46.282
All units...

01:16:46.365 --> 01:16:49.410
move on the trailer property.
Right now! Move!

01:16:56.333 --> 01:16:59.253
Shit. Local P.D.
is moving in on our guys.

01:16:59.670 --> 01:17:02.172
- Three bags in one car?
- Guess so.

01:17:15.561 --> 01:17:16.896
The cops.

01:17:21.191 --> 01:17:22.610
I am not going back to jail.

01:17:22.693 --> 01:17:24.862
Where are you going, man? Let's go!

01:17:26.238 --> 01:17:27.948
What is he doing?

01:17:49.386 --> 01:17:52.848
Now let's get the chopper over them.
I want eyes right on top.

01:17:52.931 --> 01:17:54.016
You got it.

01:17:54.099 --> 01:17:55.142
Lima 2-5...

01:17:55.225 --> 01:17:56.769
follow GPS.

01:18:05.110 --> 01:18:07.446
Do you know what you're doing?

01:18:10.532 --> 01:18:12.951
Stay with me, Rome. Come on, man.

01:18:21.251 --> 01:18:23.754
I've got them heading south
on I-95.

01:18:23.837 --> 01:18:25.923
Bring in the aerial ESDs.

01:18:35.557 --> 01:18:36.725
Oh, shit!

01:18:40.062 --> 01:18:42.940
- They're catching up, man!
- Shut up, man!

01:18:54.701 --> 01:18:56.495
Nice driving, Rome.

01:18:56.703 --> 01:18:58.414
I got you, Brian.

01:19:03.544 --> 01:19:05.045
Check it out!

01:19:17.599 --> 01:19:19.143
What was that?

01:19:29.778 --> 01:19:30.946
Oh, shit!

01:19:44.710 --> 01:19:47.379
- Come on, man. Take the wheel.
- No. I can't drive.

01:19:47.462 --> 01:19:50.757
Just hold the wheel!
Put your hands on it! Hold steady!

01:19:54.511 --> 01:19:56.305
What are you doing, man?

01:20:51.026 --> 01:20:52.361
Yeah, man!

01:21:08.377 --> 01:21:09.544
Hold.

01:21:12.089 --> 01:21:14.549
Bilkins, the bird's in place.

01:21:18.387 --> 01:21:19.554
Yeah.

01:21:21.348 --> 01:21:22.683
We've got Verone's Navigator.

01:21:22.766 --> 01:21:25.686
All right. Money's in transit.
Sit tight.

01:22:10.230 --> 01:22:12.357
You're a good driver, man.

01:22:12.441 --> 01:22:14.443
Thanks, bro.

01:22:19.322 --> 01:22:23.243
We've got the area blocked ahead.
They've got nowhere to go.

01:22:32.335 --> 01:22:33.879
What was that?

01:22:34.671 --> 01:22:35.881
I've got a visual.

01:22:36.548 --> 01:22:38.675
Video should be coming through.

01:22:38.758 --> 01:22:40.635
I got it. Looks good.

01:22:42.262 --> 01:22:44.139
Where are they going?

01:22:52.439 --> 01:22:53.607
Shit.

01:22:58.987 --> 01:23:02.282
All right, Miami's finest,
let's see what you got.

01:23:02.991 --> 01:23:05.160
Come on. Stay with me, boys.

01:23:11.166 --> 01:23:13.501
Hey, man, everyone's here.
Time for the show.

01:23:13.585 --> 01:23:15.503
Let's give it to them.

01:23:19.758 --> 01:23:22.636
All right, let the party begin.
Let's go!

01:23:41.446 --> 01:23:44.908
This is unit 25-99.
We have the suspects surrounded.

01:24:36.710 --> 01:24:38.086
Holy shit!

01:24:44.092 --> 01:24:46.594
It's a scramble, baby! A big one!

01:24:52.559 --> 01:24:54.394
Yeah! Let's do this!

01:25:02.402 --> 01:25:03.987
Check this out.

01:25:12.287 --> 01:25:14.038
We're not tracking them
on the video.

01:25:14.122 --> 01:25:16.583
We must have lost them
in the scramble.

01:25:16.666 --> 01:25:18.334
Yo, let's break.

01:25:19.794 --> 01:25:20.962
Yeah!

01:26:04.130 --> 01:26:06.466
All right, we got them going west
on Beach.

01:26:06.549 --> 01:26:08.676
Roger that! I've got them!

01:26:20.772 --> 01:26:24.108
Customs has a fix on two cars
going west on Beach.

01:26:24.525 --> 01:26:26.361
Roger. Follow those cars.

01:26:26.444 --> 01:26:27.862
Roger that.

01:26:49.968 --> 01:26:51.135
Shit.

01:26:52.178 --> 01:26:53.888
They're cornered.

01:26:58.142 --> 01:27:00.853
Keep your hands
where I can see them!

01:27:00.937 --> 01:27:02.271
Hands up!

01:27:02.814 --> 01:27:06.734
I know my tags are out of date,
but damn.

01:27:14.909 --> 01:27:16.452
What the hell?

01:27:17.787 --> 01:27:19.372
Where are they?

01:27:41.477 --> 01:27:42.979
How about them apples, man?

01:27:43.062 --> 01:27:46.149
Yeah! That's some driving
for your ass, baby!

01:27:47.567 --> 01:27:48.651
Good job, man.

01:27:48.735 --> 01:27:50.737
- What are you talking about?
- Whatever.

01:27:50.820 --> 01:27:52.780
You're supposed to be
a stone-faced killer!

01:27:52.864 --> 01:27:54.699
You were grabbing your seat belt!

01:27:54.782 --> 01:27:58.286
Hey, Tej, thanks a lot, bro.
You're clutch. I owe you big time.

01:27:58.369 --> 01:28:02.039
Yeah, Brian, you really do owe me.
You really do...

01:28:02.915 --> 01:28:03.958
Us.

01:28:04.167 --> 01:28:06.586
Suki says you owe us, all right?

01:28:08.963 --> 01:28:11.549
- Rome, you there? Come in.
- What's up, man?

01:28:11.632 --> 01:28:13.801
Looks like we got
just one trick left.

01:28:13.885 --> 01:28:16.596
My pleasure, buddy!
Let's do it, baby!

01:28:17.555 --> 01:28:19.766
Maybe we should grab Verone
while we still can.

01:28:19.849 --> 01:28:21.309
No! Not yet!

01:28:23.436 --> 01:28:24.604
What?

01:28:24.687 --> 01:28:25.813
You lost them?

01:28:25.897 --> 01:28:27.064
Shit!

01:28:27.273 --> 01:28:28.733
Those little pricks are running!

01:28:28.816 --> 01:28:30.568
It's your call.
What do you want to do?

01:28:30.651 --> 01:28:33.196
We're gonna take him down.
He is not leaving here.

01:28:33.821 --> 01:28:35.573
Enjoying the ride?

01:28:36.574 --> 01:28:38.242
It's a fast car, huh?

01:28:40.036 --> 01:28:42.205
It's a classic. Old school.

01:28:42.663 --> 01:28:44.332
American muscle.

01:28:46.417 --> 01:28:50.004
This car can do all kinds of things.
Want to see?

01:28:51.923 --> 01:28:54.050
Check this out right here, homey.

01:28:54.133 --> 01:28:56.427
Hey, what are you doing,
man?

01:29:05.978 --> 01:29:07.480
Ejecto seato!

01:29:08.147 --> 01:29:10.483
It worked! I love this button!

01:29:12.860 --> 01:29:14.612
Stay on your toes!

01:29:15.738 --> 01:29:19.200
Mr. O'Conner, it worked!
Blow and go. I'm all clear.

01:29:19.450 --> 01:29:21.994
Meet me at the point!
Hurry up! It's on!

01:29:22.078 --> 01:29:23.162
All right. 10-4, man.

01:29:23.246 --> 01:29:25.081
Are you ready? Let's go!

01:29:35.466 --> 01:29:38.177
Let me see your hands!

01:29:38.261 --> 01:29:39.512
Freeze!

01:29:40.304 --> 01:29:41.514
Clear!

01:29:47.895 --> 01:29:51.732
- It's not Verone and Fuentes.
- What do you mean?

01:29:51.983 --> 01:29:52.942
Then where the hell are they?

01:30:00.533 --> 01:30:02.576
Get off at Tarpon Point.

01:30:03.327 --> 01:30:06.664
Tarpon Point?
There's no airstrip at Tarpon Point.

01:30:07.498 --> 01:30:10.126
Who said anything about an airstrip?

01:30:23.305 --> 01:30:24.515
Brian?

01:30:25.224 --> 01:30:27.059
What's the hold-up, bro?

01:30:27.268 --> 01:30:29.770
Yo. There's a new plan.
What the hell?

01:30:29.854 --> 01:30:33.274
We meet him at Tarpon Point exit,
not the airstrip.

01:30:33.357 --> 01:30:36.777
- So, what are you saying?
- Like I said, there's a new plan.

01:30:39.113 --> 01:30:40.322
Brian?

01:30:40.865 --> 01:30:42.908
Brian? Hello, you there?

01:30:44.994 --> 01:30:46.078
Damn!

01:30:46.162 --> 01:30:47.621
What the hell is he doing?

01:30:47.705 --> 01:30:49.373
The feds are in the wrong place.

01:30:49.457 --> 01:30:51.625
Brian's woman is on her own
with Verone.

01:30:51.709 --> 01:30:52.752
So...

01:30:52.835 --> 01:30:54.754
So Brian's not coming!

01:31:10.895 --> 01:31:12.938
- Let him out.
- Get out.

01:31:20.571 --> 01:31:21.697
Pop the trunk.

01:31:24.158 --> 01:31:25.493
Hurry up.

01:31:41.008 --> 01:31:42.259
Where's the rest?

01:31:42.343 --> 01:31:44.261
- The other car.
- Another car?

01:31:44.720 --> 01:31:47.139
- Where's the other car?
- On its way.

01:31:47.223 --> 01:31:48.933
- On the way?
- Yeah.

01:31:50.142 --> 01:31:51.393
Here's your money.

01:31:51.477 --> 01:31:54.814
So you know nothing about the agents
that stormed my jet?

01:32:01.695 --> 01:32:05.199
The funny thing is, I only told
one person about the airstrip.

01:32:19.588 --> 01:32:23.259
Customs agents sure
are getting pretty, aren't they?

01:32:27.555 --> 01:32:29.306
Put her on the boat.

01:32:31.392 --> 01:32:33.561
- Let's go.
- Get on the boat.

01:32:48.033 --> 01:32:50.160
Hide the cars and get rid of him.

01:32:50.244 --> 01:32:51.745
Back in the car.

01:33:19.440 --> 01:33:20.816
End of the road.

01:33:23.277 --> 01:33:24.695
You know, I like you.

01:33:24.778 --> 01:33:27.740
But I still got to kill you.
It's my job.

01:33:31.327 --> 01:33:32.661
What's that?

01:33:34.121 --> 01:33:35.706
It's Barstow, baby!

01:33:36.081 --> 01:33:37.791
It's about to get ugly!

01:33:45.758 --> 01:33:47.134
Let's go.

01:34:23.003 --> 01:34:24.254
Come on.

01:34:50.781 --> 01:34:52.199
You had me.

01:34:54.368 --> 01:34:55.828
You slipped.

01:34:57.162 --> 01:34:59.915
Eleven and a half months,
and you slipped once.

01:35:01.291 --> 01:35:03.085
Put her downstairs.

01:35:09.216 --> 01:35:10.884
See you in a second.

01:35:16.682 --> 01:35:18.016
I thought you was dead.

01:35:18.100 --> 01:35:20.269
Me, too. Thanks for saving my ass.

01:35:20.352 --> 01:35:21.645
What are you doing?

01:35:21.728 --> 01:35:25.065
If Verone sees a helicopter
or Customs boat, she's dead!

01:35:25.148 --> 01:35:26.149
Boat.

01:35:26.483 --> 01:35:28.068
Car. Boat.

01:35:28.485 --> 01:35:30.988
You're not gonna do
what I think you're gonna do?

01:35:31.071 --> 01:35:34.074
- Yeah, I think so. You got my back?
- Yeah.

01:35:34.157 --> 01:35:35.534
All right, put on the seat belt.

01:35:35.617 --> 01:35:37.411
Show him some Dukes of Hazzard shit!

01:35:37.494 --> 01:35:40.247
We're gonna do this big!
Hold on, Rome!

01:35:46.753 --> 01:35:48.422
Brian, you're crazy, man!

01:35:48.505 --> 01:35:50.257
What the hell are you doing?

01:36:16.116 --> 01:36:17.868
I think I broke my arm.

01:36:30.756 --> 01:36:32.215
Get the gun.

01:36:53.153 --> 01:36:54.738
It's over, Carter.

01:37:01.787 --> 01:37:03.038
You okay?

01:37:03.205 --> 01:37:04.372
Yeah!

01:37:05.665 --> 01:37:06.750
I'm great.

01:37:13.048 --> 01:37:14.716
We got him, man.

01:37:15.634 --> 01:37:18.220
We got him. Let's get out of here.

01:37:38.323 --> 01:37:39.741
Go, go.

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:50.585
That ought to do it.

01:37:51.253 --> 01:37:54.840
So, there were three bags total?
The three from the boat?

01:37:55.841 --> 01:37:57.676
So we're good, right?

01:37:58.051 --> 01:37:59.386
Our records are clean?

01:37:59.469 --> 01:38:01.137
You held up your end.

01:38:01.721 --> 01:38:03.390
Your records are clean.

01:38:21.533 --> 01:38:23.869
So maybe there were six bags.

01:38:24.828 --> 01:38:26.830
I guess we can call it even.

01:38:27.080 --> 01:38:28.415
Agent Dunn?

01:38:32.711 --> 01:38:34.629
We found some more evidence.

01:38:37.048 --> 01:38:38.717
Let's take it inside.

01:38:42.721 --> 01:38:44.973
Don't drop the soap, big homey.

01:38:47.309 --> 01:38:50.729
I hope you know when he gets out,
he's going to kill your ass.

01:38:52.063 --> 01:38:53.898
He ain't getting out.

01:38:55.525 --> 01:38:56.943
I'll see you soon.

01:38:57.485 --> 01:39:00.488
- You think he's going to get out?
- He'll be out.

01:39:01.698 --> 01:39:04.075
Not for real.
You think he's getting out?

01:39:04.743 --> 01:39:07.245
We took care of your decoys.
They're free and clear.

01:39:07.329 --> 01:39:09.623
There's a sedan
out on the road for you.

01:39:09.706 --> 01:39:11.875
Try to bring it back in one piece.

01:39:13.960 --> 01:39:16.463
Thanks a lot, Bilkins.
You're all right.

01:39:17.464 --> 01:39:19.174
Thanks for looking out.

01:39:21.635 --> 01:39:23.511
Do you trust me now?

01:39:23.637 --> 01:39:25.138
You're all right.

01:39:29.601 --> 01:39:30.769
Sorry.

01:39:32.145 --> 01:39:34.064
Nice working with you, O'Conner.

01:39:34.189 --> 01:39:35.523
Same here.

01:39:47.786 --> 01:39:51.873
I might have to stay here in Miami,
and keep you out of trouble, bruh.

01:39:54.667 --> 01:39:56.503
You know what I'm talking about.

01:39:56.586 --> 01:39:58.755
You're going to kick it
in Miami?

01:39:59.130 --> 01:40:02.175
I love Miami.
Miami is off the hook!

01:40:04.344 --> 01:40:06.388
Open a garage together.

01:40:07.180 --> 01:40:10.016
A garage?
How are we going to do that?

01:40:14.896 --> 01:40:16.981
Pockets ain't empty, cuz.

01:40:21.069 --> 01:40:23.321
And we ain't hungry
no more, right?
